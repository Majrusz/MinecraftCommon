This <b>forge</b> modification adds new unique enchantments to the game. \
I have tried to add enchantments that fit Minecraft and ensure that they were as \
balanced as possible. A detailed description of all enchantments can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Majrusz/MajruszsEnchantmentsMod/wiki). \
<b>Since version 1.0.0 this mod requires a [Majrusz Library](https://modrinth.com/mod/majrusz-library) to work!</b>

\- <b>17+</b> new enchantments and <b>5+</b> new curses \
\- all enchantments are highly configurable in the configuration file \
\- shields and horse armors are now enchantable \
\- supports <b>Enchantment Descriptions</b> \
\- supports <b>JEI Enchantment Info</b>
