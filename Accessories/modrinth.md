### Efficiency Bonus
All accessories have randomized efficiency bonus which makes them more or less useful. \
The description is generated dynamically to show you the final value with efficiency included.

It is possible to combine certain accessories to get a new accessory with all bonuses included. \
Some of the bonuses are even stronger in the new accessory!

### How to activate the accessory?
If you have <b>Curios API</b> installed then accessories work when placed in a new <b>Pocket</b> slot. \
Otherwise, they work only when held in the second hand.
