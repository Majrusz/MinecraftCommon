This <b>forge</b> modification progressively increases the game difficulty over time. It is inspired by the similar \
mechanics in [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org), but the difficulty also scales with [Regional Difficulty](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty) to keep Minecraft style. \
A detailed description of this mod can be found on the [Wiki](https://majruszs-progressive-difficulty.fandom.com/wiki/Majrusz%27s_Progressive_Difficulty_Wiki). \
<b>Since version 0.4.0 this mod requires a [Majrusz Library](https://modrinth.com/mod/majrusz-library) to work!</b>

Progress in the game is divided into stages, with each stage providing new difficulty tweaks and \
improving previous ones. At the moment there are three stages:

\- <b>Normal Mode</b>, which starts at the beginning of the game. \
\- <b>Expert Mode</b>, which starts when the first player enters the Nether. \
(or any dimension from other mods) \
\- <b>Master Mode</b>, which starts when you defeat the Ender Dragon.

### Groups of enemies
Enemies appear in groups with one leader and \
followers who attack the same target as the leader. \
Followers are more likely to have weapons and leaders to have armors. \

### Undead Army
The Undead Army is a new raid which starts after killing a certain amount of \
undead enemies. It has up to 5 waves, rewards the player with a treasure bag after \
finishing it, scales difficulty over time and scales difficulty with each player participating in!

### Treasure Bags
New Terraria-inspired bags that contain some extra loot and have \
a chance for one unique item. Each player receives their own Treasure Bag \
when they help to defeat a raid/boss. Currently, you can acquire them from: \
<b>Fishing</b>, <b>Undead Army</b>, <b>Raid</b>, <b>Elder Guardian</b>, <b>Warden</b>, <b>Wither</b> and <b>Ender Dragon</b>.

### Bleeding
Each animal and human being can now bleed. This is an effect that deals damage similar \
to poison and can be removed using a new item: <b>Bandage</b>. It is caused by many different sources \
such as swords, spiders or even cactuses... but the more armor you have, the less likely you are to bleed. \
It is important to keep bandages with you as the Bleeding becomes more deadly with each stage!

### Enderium Ingots
However, despite all the difficulty tweaks in the late-game, a new ore called <b>Enderium</b> can be found. \
With this ore, you can make Enderium Ingots which are used to upgrade Netherite armor and tools! \
<b>Enderium</b> ore generates in End Stone and can be found in End structures as well.

### And much more!
