[size=14px]This [b]forge[/b] modification progressively increases the game difficulty over time. It is inspired by the similar
mechanics in [url=https://www.terraria.org]Terraria[/url], but the difficulty also scales with [url=https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty]Regional Difficulty[/url] to keep Minecraft style. 
A detailed description of this mod can be found on the [url=https://github.com/Majrusz/MajruszsProgressiveDifficultyMod/wiki]Wiki[/url].[/size]
[style size=14px color=#f00]Since version 0.4.0 this mod requires a [url=/mod/majrusz-library/][color=#f00]Majrusz Library[/color][/url][/style][style size=14px color=#f00] to work![/style]

[size=14px]Progress in the game is divided into stages, with each stage providing new difficulty tweaks and
improving previous ones. At the moment there are three stages:

- [b]Normal Mode[/b], which starts at the beginning of the game.
- [b]Expert Mode[/b], which starts when the first player enters the Nether.
(or any dimension from other mods)
- [b]Master Mode[/b], which starts when you defeat the Ender Dragon.[/size]

[style b size=18px]Groups of enemies[/style]
[size=14px]Enemies appear in groups with one leader and
followers who attack the same target as the leader.
Followers are more likely to have weapons and leaders to have armors.[/size]

[style b size=18px]Undead Army[/style]
[size=14px]The Undead Army is a new raid which starts after killing a certain amount of
undead enemies. It has up to 5 waves, rewards the player with a treasure bag after
finishing it, scales difficulty over time and scales difficulty with each player participating in![/size]

[style b size=18px]Treasure Bags[/style]
[size=14px]New Terraria-inspired bags that contain some extra loot and have
a chance for one unique item. Each player receives their own Treasure Bag
when they help to defeat a raid/boss. Currently, you can acquire them from:
[b]Fishing[/b], [b]Undead Army[/b], [b]Raid[/b], [b]Elder Guardian[/b], [b]Warden[/b], [b]Wither[/b] and [b]Ender Dragon[/b].[/size]

[style b size=18px]Bleeding[/style]
[size=14px]Each animal and human being can now bleed. This is an effect that deals damage similar
to poison and can be removed using a new item: [b]Bandage[/b]. It is caused by many different sources
such as swords, spiders or even cactuses... but the more armor you have, the less likely you are to bleed.
It is important to keep bandages with you as the Bleeding becomes more deadly with each stage![/size]

[style b size=18px]Enderium Ingots[/style]
[size=14px]However, despite all the difficulty tweaks in the late-game, a new ore called [b]Enderium[/b] can be found.
With this ore, you can make Enderium Ingots which are used to upgrade Netherite armor and tools!
[b]Enderium[/b] ore generates in End Stone and can be found in End structures as well.[/size]
